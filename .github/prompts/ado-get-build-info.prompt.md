# ADO Build Info & Log Extraction (Targeted or Latest PR Build)

**MANDATORY**: Follow all instructions from #file:../instructions/ado-get-build-info.instructions.md

## Inputs

- ${input:project:edge-ai}: Azure DevOps project name or ID (REQUIRED)
- ${input:repository:edge-ai}: Repository name or ID (RECOMMENDED when deriving PR from commit; required if using commit discovery without prId/buildId)
- ${input:prId}: Pull Request numeric ID (OPTIONAL if buildId supplied OR derivable from current commit). Used to derive branchName `refs/pull/${input:prId}/merge`.
- ${input:buildId}: Explicit Build ID to inspect (OPTIONAL). If provided, it TAKES PRIORITY over prId or commit discovery.
- ${input:includeAllLogs:false}: Boolean; when true, persist entire logs (not just filtered excerpts) in addition to summary sections.
- ${input:maxLogLinesPerSection:400}: Cap for lines captured per logical failing section (ignored when includeAllLogs=true).
- ${input:errorContextWindow:40}: Number of context lines (before + after) around each detected error anchor (split as evenly as possible, bias earlier if odd).
- ${input:definitionFilter}: Optional build definition name substring (case-insensitive) to narrow PR build selection when multiple parallel builds exist.
- ${input:branchOverride}: Optional explicit branchName (overrides prId & commit derived branch).
- ${input:fetchSuccessfulLogs:false}: When true, still capture key success indicators (final steps, test summaries) even if Result = Succeeded.
- ${input:logIds}: Optional comma-separated list of specific logId integers to force retrieval focus (used only after metadata enumeration; others skipped unless includeAllLogs=true).
- ${input:autoDiscoverPr:true}: Boolean; when true AND prId & buildId absent, attempt to derive prId via current `mcp_ado_repo_list_pull_requests_by_repo` with `created_by_me` set to `true` and `status` set to `Active`.
- ${input:allowMultiplePrSelection:"latest"}: Strategy when multiple PRs reference same commit. Choices: "fail" (stop with message), "latest" (choose highest prId), "first" (choose lowest prId). Defaults to latest.
- ${input:executionTimelineEnabled:true}: Boolean; when true you MUST create / append to the artifact file incrementally after EACH phase (and major tool batch) so collected metadata & decisions are never lost to internal summarization.
- ${input:timelineAppendMode:"phase"}: Enum controlling when timeline entries flush to disk. Supported: "phase" (after each numbered phase & early error), "tool-batch" (after each grouped tool batch AND phase), "final" (only at end â€“ NOT RECOMMENDED). Default phase. If value not recognized, fall back to phase.
- ${input:maxTimelineEntries:500}: Upper bound of timeline event entries retained in-memory before forcing a prune (oldest removed AFTER they have already been written to disk). This protects memory if very long sessions.

Proceed with build retrieval and log extraction by following all phases in order.
