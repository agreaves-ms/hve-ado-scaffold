# Commit Message Guidelines

This document provides instructions for generating standardized commit messages.

## Format Requirements

- Use Conventional Commit Messages
- All changes MUST be in present tense

## Types

Allowed types:

- `feat` - A new feature
- `fix` - A bug fix
- `refactor` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` - A code change that improves performance
- `style` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `test` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `docs` - Documentation only changes
- `build` - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ops` - Changes to operational components
- `chore` - Other changes that don't modify src or test files

## Scopes

Allowed scopes:

- `(prompts)`
- `(instructions)`
- `(settings)`
- `(scripts)`
- `(adrs)`
- `(build)`
- `(src)`

## Description

- Description MUST be short and LESS THAN 4 specific points
- Descriptions can describe multiple different types of changes
- Examples:

```txt
feat: update logic with new feature, add value to config.json
chore: clean up and move code from A to B, delete C
feat(scripts): add parameters to take name instead of id
```

## Body (Optional)

For large and significant changes only:

- Body starts with a blank line
- Contains a summarized bulleted list of changes

## Footer

- Footer MUST start with a blank line
- Must include an emoji that represents the change
- Must end with ` - Generated by Copilot`
