# Azure DevOps Work Items Planning Instructions

Provide a single, consistent source of truth for:
* Defining and maintaining planning workitem artifacts
* Determining similarity against existing Azure DevOps work items
* Routine state persistence for summarization and resumable work item planning
* Define a stable execution handoff for workitem creation and updating

## Artifact Definitions & Directory Conventions

Root planning workspace structure (PRD-focused planning only):

<!-- <artifact-structure> -->
```plain
.copilot-tracking/
  workitems/
    <artifact-type>/
      <artifact-normalized-name>/
        artifact-analysis.md                    # Human-readable table + recommendations
        work-items.md                           # Human/Machine-readable plan (source of truth)
        handoff.md                              # Handoff for workitem execution (optionally references work-items.json if JSON variant produced)
        planning-log.md                         # Structured operational & state log (routinely updated sections)
```
Normalization: lower-case, hyphenated base filename without extension (e.g. `docs/Customer Onboarding PRD.md` â†’ `docs--customer-onboarding-prd`). Avoid spaces and punctuation besides hyphens.
<!-- </artifact-structure> -->

### Artifact Field / Section Requirements

**Markdown required format**:
* `*.md` files MUST start with:
  ```
  <!-- markdownlint-disable-file -->
  <!-- markdown-table-prettify-ignore-start -->
  ```
* `*.md` files MUST end with:
  ```
  <!-- markdown-table-prettify-ignore-end -->
  ```

#### artifact-analysis.md

Sections (fixed order):
1. Title line: e.g., `# PRD Work Item Analysis - [Summarized Title]`
2. Source Metadata (bolded bullet list): e.g., File, Parsed, Project, AreaPath?, IterationPath?
3. Planned Work Items (sections with bolded bullet list of details): e.g.,
  ````markdown
  ## Planned Work Items

  ### WI002 - Update Component Functionality A
  * **Working Title**: As a user, I want functionality A in Component
  * **Working Type**: User Story
  * **Working Action**: Create
  * **Key Search Terms**: "example term", "another", "term"
  * **Existing IDs**: N/A [or Related WorkItemID (confidence) e.g., 102 (0.5), 103 (0.9), 104 (0.1)]

  #### WI002 - Working Related & Discovered Information
  * Key details from file: Identifies this functionality as a high priority, Suggests related work for this functionality
  * `Specific Section X` refers to specific requirement described here for functionality A
  * `Specific Section X` refers to specific requirement described here for functionality C that needs functionality A
  * `Specific Section W` refers to functional requirements that relates to functionality A:
    * Functionality A becomes possible
  * User mentioned specific requirement in conversation
  * Functionality A needed in codefiles found in codebase [searched codebase]:
    * relative/path/to/file.ext - supports component but missing functionality A
    * relative/path/to/file2.ext - references functionality related to functionality A
  * `Specific Section Y` refers to functionality that's no longer needed after functionality A found in codebase [searched codebase]:
    * relative/path/to/old-file-3.ext

  #### WI002 - Working Description
    ```markdown
    ## As a user (updated to match style and tone from mcp ado searched work items)
    As a user, I want to update component with new functionality A. So I can do this specific thing that I want with this component that was called out in the document.

    ## Requirements

#### planning-log.md (Structured Mutable Log)
Generic, process-agnostic markdown log. Sections are routinely UPDATED in-place (tables grow; snapshot replaced; keyword groups rewritten). Historical fidelity is maintained through additive table rows and optional Decisions notes rather than enforcing append-only semantics.

| User Story | âœ… | System.Title, System.Description, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.AcceptanceCriteria, Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority, Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ValueArea |

Rules:
* Feature requires Epic parent.
* User Story requires Feature parent.

## Search Keyword & Search Text Protocol

Goal: Deterministic, resumable discovery of existing work items.

<!-- <search-keyword-protocol> -->
Steps:
1. Maintain ACTIVE KEYWORD GROUPS: ordered list, each group = 1â€“4 specific terms (multiâ€‘word allowed) joined by OR.
2. Compose `searchText`:
  * Single group â†’ `(term1 OR "multi word")`
  * Multiple groups â†’ `(group1) AND (group2)` etc.
3. Execute search (page size suggested: 50). For every related result ID:
  * Fetch full work item immediately and update planning-log.md.
  * Compute similarity (semantic intent focus, not token count).
  * Assign action via matrix.

Similarity Computation Guidance:
* Use combined semantic representation of (title + description + acceptance).
* Boost for aligned outcome/goal verbs; penalize scope or persona mismatch.
* Store raw float, round to 2 decimals for `similarity` field.
<!-- </search-keyword-protocol> -->

<!-- <similarity-decision-matrix> -->
| Similarity | Action | Interpretation |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| â‰¥ 0.70 | update | Strong alignment with existing item intent |
| 0.50â€“0.69 | review | Potential alignment; needs manual confirmation |
| < 0.50 | create | No sufficiently aligned existing item |
<!-- </similarity-decision-matrix> -->


## Routine State Persistence & Summarization Protocol

<!-- <state-persistence-protocol> -->
Must maintain planning-log.md routinely by keeping it up to date as information is discovered.
Must add and update work items in work-items.md as information is discovered.
Must add and update planning-log.md for each new artifact, keyword group, Azure DevOps work item, etc.

### Required Pre-Summarization
Summarization must also include the following (or else you will likely cause breaking changes):
* Full paths to all working files with a summary describing each file and its purpose
* Anything that was not captured into the planning-log.md file or other artifacts that should have been captured before summarization
  * Specifically state exactly what needs to be done again (use the mcp_ado_wit_get_work_item tool with ID ### again, etc)
* Exact work item IDs that were already reviewed
* Exact work item IDs that are left to be reviewed
* Exact work item IDs that were already reviewed but likely not captured into the planning-log.md file or other artifacts
* Exact planning steps that you were previously on (must repeat if data was not captured into artifacts)
* Exact planning steps that are still required
* Any potential work item search criteria that is still required

### Required Post-Summarization Recovery
If context has `<summary>` and only one tool call, then immediately do the following protocol before any additional edits/decisions:

1. **State File Validation**:
  * It's likely you've lost valuable information and you are now required to recover your context to avoid broken changes
  * Use the `list_dir` tool under the `.copilot-tracking/workitems/<artifact-type>/<artifact-normalized-name>` working folder
  * Use the `read_file` tool to read back in all of the planning-log.md to build back context

2. **Context Reconstruction User Update**:
  Let the user know that you are working on rebuilding your context:

  ```markdown
  ## Resuming After Context Summarization

  I notice our conversation history was summarized. Let me rebuild context:

  ðŸ“‹ **[Analyzing Title]**: [Analyze planning-log.md and current work item content]

  To ensure continuity, I'll do the following:
  * [List protocol that you plan to follow next]

  Would you like me to proceed with this approach?
  ```
